# About Me

Hi, I'm Thapelo Mohlala and I come from a small township of Matsulu just outside Mbombela, South Africa. That's where my love for technology has shaped much of my personal and professional journey. From a young age, I was fascinated by how things worked, whether it was a gadget, computer, or any piece of electronics I could get my hands on. Growing up in an environment where access to technology was limited made my curiosity even more intense. I would find ways to learn and explore, even with scarce resources.

In high school, I took my passion further. I began teaching myself basic programming and understanding computer hardware through any available resources—old books, online materials, and tutorials. Even though I didn’t always have the latest technology, I made do with what I had. This self-taught attitude became an important part of my character. If there was something I didn’t know, I would figure it out. I never let the lack of formal resources limit my progress.

After high school, I enrolled in a tertiary institution to pursue a Computer Systems Diploma. This was a significant milestone for me, as it was the first step towards realizing my dreams. I dove deep into my studies, eager to learn everything about computer systems, networking, and programming. However, my journey took an unexpected turn when financial issues arose, and I was unable to complete my diploma. It was a difficult setback, one that many people in my community face, but I refused to let it define me.

Even though I couldn’t finish my formal education, my passion for technology remained as strong as ever. I decided to take matters into my own hands and continue learning on my own. I embraced my self-taught nature, seeking out online courses, free resources, and communities where I could continue to grow my skills. I began experimenting with different programming languages, learning about web development, and even creating a few simple website projects. The world of technology is vast, and I was determined to explore as much of it as I could.

Today, I continue to grow in my technology journey, working on personal projects and contributing to my community by solving tech-related problems. I believe that technology holds immense potential, not just in big cities, but also in small communities like mine. My dream is to use my skills to make a meaningful impact, helping others harness the power of technology to improve their lives.
